# SolidWorks-Macros
This set of SolidWorks macros is developed to automate repetitive tasks involved in creating and managing engineering drawings, particularly focusing on balloons, BOMs, views, and blocks. They streamline the detailing process, improve consistency, and reduce manual work across single and multi-sheet drawings.
